# Transboundary damages
Supporting code and data for analysis on health damages incurred from transferred pollution in the U.S.

# Emissions data
Contains code for procecssing raw data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for use in the AP3 model.

Because of the large size of the NEI data, the data is not posted here but is available at https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory-nei or upon request. Data files should include Onroad, Nonroad, Nonpoint, Facility level, and process emissions worksheets. 

The 2014 eGrid data is also used to supplement the NEI and is available from https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid-questions-and-answers or on request. Note that downloaded NEI files should be placed in their corresponding folders and renamed to match naming convention in Emissions breakdown V3.R.

Users should ensure that working directory references and filenames are updated at the beginning of Emissions breakdown V3.R.
